# Monte Carlo Simulation of a Stock Portfolio

This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of a stock portfolio over a specified period. The simulation calculates the potential future values of the portfolio based on historical stock data, and computes Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for risk assessment.
